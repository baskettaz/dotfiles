# Preview

This repository should serve to automate all my personal LINUX-preferences after a fresh installation or to be used as defaults. It will **irreversevely** re-configurate your setup and should be payed attention to, if this is copied for personal use. 

I'll try to keep up with the iterations of the installation files and to document properly the sources and the reasons for the changes. If something is missing or misinterpreted, please feel free to contact me.

# Organization

The structure and the logic of the files and folders aren't clear enough. To try to reogranize them, MindMaps will be used to make them much more accessible and comprehensive (There is an issue with the choice of the MindMap program, which will be used, because it will make unwanted **dependency**. For the moment the choice is on miro.com, but draw.io is also a good option.To be decided later ...)
