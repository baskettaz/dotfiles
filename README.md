This repository should serve to automate all my personal LINUX-preferences after a fresh installation or to be used as defaults. It will **irreversevely** re-configurate your setup and should be payed attention to, if this is copied for personal use. 

I'll try to keep up with the iterations of the installation files and to document properly the sources and the reasons for the changes. If something is missing or misinterpreted, please feel free to contact me.
